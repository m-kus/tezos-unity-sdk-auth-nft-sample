# Tezos Unity SDK / Auth & NFT sample

Demo scene showcasing the usage of the Authentication prefab and TzKT API for querying token balances / metadata.  

Includes:

* Wallet authentication through the prefab
* Examples of API usage for the following use cases:
    - "Do I have NFT X"? (Thus, the currently authenticated user)
    - "Does user with address of "tzABCD...1234" have NFT X"? (Thus, NOT the currently authenticated user)
    - "List all NFTS for user with address of "tzABCD...1234" "? (Thus, NOT the currently authenticated user)
